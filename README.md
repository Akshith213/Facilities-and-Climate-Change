# Facilities and Climate Change: Embracing Sustainability for a Greener Future

In this pivotal project, we dove deep into the pressing issue of climate change, aligning our goals with SDG 13 - Climate Action. Our objective was to identify facilities within the European Union with similar emission profiles, establishing correlations between varying pollutants and shifts in climate variables. By constructing an innovative predictive model, we could forecast the environmental impact based on specific emission profiles.

## Key Highlights:

- **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Used the European Pollutant and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) and the Daily Global Historical Climatology Network, processing vast datasets (30GB+) spanning over 100,000 global weather stations.
  
- **Big Data Analytics:** Leveraged PySpark and Big Query for data analysis and Spark RDDs for preprocessing. Successfully averaged and processed multiple climate variables across the EU.
  
- **Emission Profiling:** Integrated diverse datasets to derive emission profiles for European Union facilities.
  
- **Machine Learning:** Employed LSTM neural networks to devise a predictive model that forecasts climatic shifts based on emission data.
  
- **Data Science Techniques:** Utilized Locality Sensitive Hashing and MinHashing for similarity search among emission profiles and created correlation matrices to understand pollutant-climate relationships.
  
- **Policy Insights:** Our findings empower policymakers to draft informed strategies, emphasizing facilities with similar environmental footprints. The predictive model also aids in understanding a new facility's potential climate impact.

## Applications:

The methodologies and techniques applied in this project can be instrumental for:

- **Policy-making:** Assisting policymakers in framing well-informed decisions and strategies for environmental conservation.
  
- **Environmental Studies:** Analyzing the impact of various pollutants and strategizing methods to curtail them.
  
- **Business Intelligence:** Helping industries comprehend the environmental footprint of their facilities and devise strategies to minimize detrimental impacts.
  
- **Predictive Analysis:** Offering businesses insights into potential future scenarios based on current actions.

This project exemplified a blend of big data analytics, data engineering, machine learning, and software engineering, cementing a robust foundation in the realm of data science and environmental sustainability.
